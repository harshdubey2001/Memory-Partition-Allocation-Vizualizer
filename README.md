# Memory-Partition-Allocation-Vizualizer

A web-based tool called Memory Allocation Visualizer was created to aid computer science students in their understanding of memory partition allocation. First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, and Next Fit are just a few of the memory allocation techniques that may be explored interactively and practically using this application.

The Memory Allocation Visualizer has a straightforward homepage with a navigation bar at the top that has links to the various allocation algorithms. Users can simulate RAM partition allocation using their preferred technique and view the results in real-time thanks to the tool's interactive interface. To test out alternative scenarios, users can also change a number of settings, like the amount of memory and the number of processes.
